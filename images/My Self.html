                <ul><li><strong><ins><em>CRICKET</em></ins></strong></li></ul>
                    <p>Cricket is my favorite hobby and a famous sport too. It makes me feel healthy, fit and 
                        a stronger person. It makes me feel confident and proud of what I am. I started 
                        playing cricket when I was a kid of 7 years old.My cricket passion started when I 
                        was a small kid and I started playing this game with my elder brother in the back 
                        side of my home.At that time also I was a good player in comparison to the children 
                        of my age. May be because I love to play cricket and I play it too seriously focusing 
                        on each and every ball.</p>
                        <p>Like many other people in India I was also aspired to play for my country. My days 
                            were never complete without cricket I used to play with my friends after my school 
                            hours were over. I use my left hand to hold the bat &amp; bowl the ball which many 
                            people found strange but I was comfortable playing. Later with time I learnt to 
                            play cricket well and started participating in my school teams. I was appreciated 
                            by the match viewers as I used to be the highest score holder of the match. I was 
                            identified as the best bowler of the Lawrence School (my school) at the age of 14 
                            which was a great achievement for me and my parents in the year 2000.</p>
                        <p>My favorite cricket player is SachinTendulkar. During my farewell I was also 
                            honored with a certificate to appraise my contribution to my school cricket team. 
                            My cricket skills helped me to flatter Susain (my first girlfriend) when I was 20 
                            years old. Later when I was 22 years old I became a part of Vishvya Bhartiya Vidya 
                            Sansthan &amp; represented my teams in several tournaments.</p>
                        <p>But unfortunately we didn’t achieved much. I was disheartened and then Susain too left 
                            me because she dint find me her hero anymore. She thought I am a big looser. Later I 
                            took training from Sir Josheph. He taught me so many minute things and trained me to 
                            play perfectly. Today I am a member of Nitya Nanayang Polytechnic team. I am proud to 
                            be a part of this team.</p><hr>
                    <ul><li><strong><ins><em>BADMINTON</em></ins></strong></li></ul>
                          <p>In life, one needs a hobby that keeps him or her busy during their free time. I am a 
                            sports lover, and my hobby over the years has been badminton. My love for this sport 
                            started at a young age, and ever since then, I have not only admired the game but come 
                            to play it with absolute passion.If you see me all geared up and playing the game, you 
                            might confuse me for Lin Dan, whom I admire quite a lot. My love over the years for this 
                            hobby has seen me live and breathe it as respect all that it has done for me.For you to 
                            play badminton, you have to be well geared up for it. It’s just like any sport that you 
                            cannot go to the field in your casual clothing. I have invested over the years in the right 
                            gear, which includes shorts, pairs of sneakers, and all protective and bands so that as I 
                            enjoy my hobby, I feel like a real pro.</p>
                            <p>My friends have come to realize how serious I take the sport, and they do not mind once 
                            in a while joining me for a fun evening just away from the hustle and stresses of life. 
                            Leisure for me is always an enjoyable affair, and I never get tired of playing the game. 
                            I do not have to worry anymore about seeking therapy as badminton has it all covered for me.
                            One of the biggest desires for me in life has always been that I remain fit. One may think 
                            that badminton is not a game that you can achieve your fitness goals with, but I may disagree 
                            with them. This game involves the whole body, and the fact that one hit of the shuttlecock 
                            with the racquet may make one go from one end to another just to hit it back is an excellent 
                            form of exercise.The game may be plaid in doubles or singles, which means two players on one 
                            side or one player against another, respectively. The lesser the number for me, the more 
                            competitive it is, and one the other hand, the more the number, the greater the fun.</p>
